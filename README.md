# 🏠 House Price Prediction System (Machine Learning)

This project is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. The model is built using **Linear Regression** and includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
